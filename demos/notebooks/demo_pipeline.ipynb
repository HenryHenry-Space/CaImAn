    "# CNMF demo pipeline: Intro\n",
    "This demo presents a full pipeline for the analysis of a two-photon calcium imaging dataset using the CaImAn (**Ca**lcium **Im**aging **An**alysis) software package. It demonstrates how to use Caiman's built-in tools for the following three analysis steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![full workflow cartoon](../../docs/img/full_cnmf_workflow.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Apply the NoRMCorre (nonrigid motion correction) algorithm for motion correction.\n",
    "2) Apply the constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) source separation algorithm to extract an initial estimate of neuronal spatial footprint and calcium traces.  \n",
    "3) Apply quality control metrics to evaluate the initial estimates, and narrow down to the final set of estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNMF algorithm is best for data with relatively low background noise, like most two-photon data and *some* one photon data (e.g., certain light sheet data). For a demo analysis pipeline of a one-photon microendoscopic data set see `demo_pipeline_cnmfE.ipynb`."

    "If you hit memory issues later, there are a few things you can do. First, you may want to lower the number of processors you are using. Each processor uses more RAM, and on a workstation with many processors, you can sometimes get better performance by reducing <em>num_processors_to_use</em>. This is a bit of an art form, so the best way to determine the optimal number is by trial and error. When you set <em>num_processors_to_use</em> variable to <em>None</em>, it defaults to <i>one</i> less than the total number of CPU cores available (the reason we don't automatically set it to the total number of cores is because in practice this typically leads to worse performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if your system has less than 32GB of RAM, and things are running slowly or you are running out of memory, then get more RAM. While you can sometimes get away with less, we recommend a *bare minimum* level of 16GB of RAM, but more is better. 32GB RAM is acceptable, 64GB or more is best. Obviously, this will depend on the size of your data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, if none of your memory optimizations work, you may just have too much data for offline CNMF. For this case, we also provide an online version of CNMF (OnACID), which uses a small number of frames to initialize the spatial and temporal components, and iteratively updates them with new data. This uses much less memory than the offline approach. The demo notebook for OnACID is found in <a href=\"./demo_OnACID_mesoscope.ipynb\">demo_OnACID_mesoscope.ipynb</a>.

This is so that the CNMF algorithm will be able to properly estimate local background activity. Also the larger the patch size, the less parallelization will be used by Caiman.

If the filter is appropriately matched to your data, you will get a much better estimate, so this is a very important parameter for initialization. It is related to the `gSiz` parameter, which is typically set to `2*gSig + 1` for CNMF. `gSiz` is the size (in pixels) of a bounding box created around each seed pixel during initilialization -- if after running `refit()` your neurons end up looking square or artificially cut off, you may need to increase `gSiz`.\n",

You will only receive messages above the severity threshold you set: you can choose from: `logging.DEBUG`, `logging.INFO`, `logging.WARNING`, `logging.ERROR`, or `logging.CRITICAL`. For instance, setting the threshold to `logging.DEBUG` will print out every logging statement, while setting it to `logging.ERROR` will print out only errors and critical messages. This system gives much more flexibility and control than interspersing `print()` statements throughought your code when debugging. \n",

One, you just load *some* of a movie into a movie object using the `subindices` argument to the `load()` function.

    "We mentioned in the body of the notebook that we save the motion corrected file as a memory mapped file. In general, memory mapped files are binary files saved to disk, and the operating system can work with them as if they were in RAM by just loading parts of the files into memory when needed for particular computations. This is known as *out of core computation*. This is how Caiman is able to work with large files without loading them into RAM. \n",

    "\n",
    "This is important because certain operations are much faster on C-order arrays vs F-order arrays. For motion correction, which needs to access contiguous sequences of frames (often in the middle of the movie), it is much more efficient to read and write in F order. On the other hand, when it comes to CNMF, you need to access individual pixels across the entire movie, so Caiman saves the motion-corrected movie in C-order before running CNMF."
