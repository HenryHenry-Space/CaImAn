Caiman generally works fine under SLURM, on a single node allocated for use with an interactive run.

The code in this directory is for a past attempt at something different: SLURM integration with the ipyparallel
backend, resulting in SLURM running caiman in parallel over a number of nodes. This mode was never documented and
likely never saw use outside where Caiman was developed, possibly never seeing use after about 2017.

It is unclear whether this mode ever provided performance benefits over running on a single reasonably fast node.

If you're using this, we likely will not be able to support you if anything goes wrong, and support for this
mode may be removed from Caiman at some point. To try it out, you will need to know SLURM very well and be
comfortable reading the code.
